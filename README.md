## 🚀 Project Summary

This repository contains my solution for the **Chatbot Arena Preference Prediction** Kaggle competition.  
The challenge was to predict **which chatbot response a human judge preferred**, given a prompt and two responses.

> The submission ranked **44th** on the public leaderboard out of hundreds of global teams 🌍.

## 🧠 The Approach

- ✨ Fine-tuned transformer-based models on human preference data.
- 🔍 Analyzed semantic similarities between responses.
- ⚖️ Normalized token lengths and prompt alignment.
- 🔀 Applied ensemble strategies to combine model strengths.
- 🧪 Used stratified validation to handle subjectivity and avoid leakage.
